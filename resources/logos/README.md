Place your app icons here. Suggested filenames and sizes:

- `icon.png`: 512x512 (used for dev + Windows/Linux packaging)
- `icon.ico`: multi-size Windows icon (16/32/48/64/128/256)
- `icon.icns`: macOS iconset
- `tray.png` (optional): 24x24 or 32x32

Electron Builder will look in `resources/logos` by default via `electron-builder.yml`. Replace these placeholders with your final logo assets before packaging.
